Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm not waiting for heaven
Step it up and take it to the top
You can't get high enough, I've been told
Close your eyes and wait for paradise
Repeat until you die, life is cold

What if I would look down?
See how far I've come
What if my time is now?
I'm coming to life
I'm super high, super high
I'm crossing the line
It's pretty fly, pretty fly
The crazy is now
'Cause it's my time, it's my time
I'm not waiting for heaven
Not waiting for heaven

 Smash Into Pieces
